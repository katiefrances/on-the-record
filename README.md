# On The Record

One The Record is a two-sided marketplace application written in Ruby on Rails that provides a two-sided marketplace for buying & selling records online. 

>“Vinyl is the real deal. I've always felt like, until you buy the vinyl record, you don't really own the album. And it's not just me or a little pet thing or some kind of retro romantic thing from the past. It is still alive.” ⸺ Jack White



# The Problem

As current record sales in Australia are increasing, there needs to be more of a supply of record sales to match the demand, especially with the popularity of events like Record Store Day, and the fact that most customers are happier to buy local & support local businesses, even if the cost is slightly higher. There is a gap in the market for a well designed, user friendly app that caters to this gap.

## _Why is there a need for the site?_

There are not enough two-sided marketplace record stores, especially located within Australia that cater for the second hand market. There are a few sites, but they are mainly linked to physical stores which require you to contact them to buy or sell.

There are sites for selling records eg Amazon, EBay etc but they are not set up for selling records person to person, they are only for buyers and there is a lot of content to sift through to find what you're looking for.

## _What's wrong with sites that already exist?_

Most of the online record stores in Australia are badly designed sites with too much text, bad images, awful user interface design, and not enough categorisation of genres. I was only able to find one site that I would consider well designed and easily navigable. Most if not all of the sites online are not two-sided marketplaces and only sell new records.

I believe users would appreciate having a better shopping experience with a clearer minimalist design. A better user interface would also help boost sales as users are more able to purchase records sorted into better categories and genres with a searchable database.

An example of one of these sites would be 
[Revolve Records](http://www.revolverecords.com.au/), they are a site that sells records online, however their site design & layout are unappealing and inefficient even though the site functionality is good.

There are a many ways that this site could be improved, a few could be:
- Changing the general design & Interface
- Moving the search to the top of the page on the homepage
- Implementing a simpler, better laid out homepage
- Better colours, the current colour scheme is awful


## _Why within Australia?_

There are many international sites for buying records, however the shipping costs can be exponential, and I can't say how many times I've started a purchase and not completed it due to shipping costs. Having an Australian established site means that these costs are much less, which then will generate more sales if users are paying less.

# The Solution

To create an application that provides the user with the ability to purchase and sell records online easily without hassle. It would also provide the user with the ability to communicate with the seller or vice versa.

## _Create an app that provides 2 sided marketplace functionality_

Creating this app makes the user experience better because then users wouldn't have to contact a physical seller to either buy or sell their records which makes the user's experience better overall because they don't have to navigate through a badly laid out site that isn't going to help them easily make a purchase.

## _Provide the user with a better shopping experience_

If the site is well laid out, well categorised & easily searchable, the user is much more likely to make a purchase. If the shopping experience is made easier, the user interface and experience is easier and

# Fonts

## Roboto

I picked Roboto for the main text because it is an internet standard, easily readable, design adaptable font. It is also the official Google font and is being adapated by more and more sites due to these factors. It scales extremely well and provides a great user experience. 

> "Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm, Roboto doesn’t compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their natural width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in humanist and serif types." ⸺ Google Fonts

## Alfa Slab One

For the headings I picked Alfa Slab One because it is also highly readable and is easily distinguishable as a nice bold heading font. I really like the contrast between these two fonts, they compliment each other excellently and are extremely readable and eye pleasing.

> "Alfa Slab One is a contemporary take on the Six-lines Pica Egyptian created by Robert Thorne for the Thorowgood Foundry in 1921. Although initially based on that model, Alfa Slab One was designed with an extreme stem weight, big serifs, more stem contrast and gradual terminals with a single serif. All this attributes give Alfa Slab One a contemporary look with extreme black density." ⸺ Google Fonts
